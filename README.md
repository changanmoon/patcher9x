# Patch for Windows 3.11/95/98/98 SE/Me to fix CPU issues
Virtualization of Microsoft Windows 3.11/9x systems can be problematic due to a few major bugs:
[the TLB invalidation bug](#patch-to-fix-tlb-invalidation-bug), [the CPU speed limit bug](#patch-to-fix-cpu-speed-limit-bug), and [issues with Memory Limit](#memory-limit-patch) and [Dirty control registers](#dirty-control-registry-patch).

This program contains a set of patches to fix these bugs and can be booted from a floppy disk on a virtual machine. It can either apply the patch to the installed system or patch the installation files to create (relatively) bug-free installation media.

## Patch to fix TLB invalidation bug

MS Windows 98 may not run on newer CPUs (even in a virtual machine) due to the "TLB invalidation bug." The bug is described here: https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2015/08/win9x-tlb-invalidation-bug/

If you want to run a virtual machine without restrictions with Windows 98 on AMD Zen 2 and newer (Ryzen 3000+) or Intel Core 11th generation and newer (code names Rocket Lake, Tiger Lake), you likely need this patch.

## Patch to fix CPU speed limit bug

Windows 95 and 98 FE (first edition) won't run on any CPU with frequency of ~2GHz and more due to dividing by zero in the CPU speed test. The bug is described and located here: https://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29224

There is also an older patch for this bug [FIX95CPU](http://www.tmeeco.eu/9X4EVER/GOODIES/FIX95CPU_V3_FINAL.ZIP), but it's only for Windows 95, doesn't integrate the "divide by zero" protection and also it's incrementing the number of cycles in the testing loop only 10 times of original which probably isn't enough for future CPUs. You can test your CPU speed with this command:

```
patcher9x -cputest
```

## Memory limit patch

Windows 9x cannot reliably work with more than about ~512 MB of RAM. There's no strict barrier, but bugs in the FAT driver (`VCACHE.VXD`) cause more memory to result in the cache not fitting into system memory space, overwriting the memory of other drivers. With more RAM, the chance of hitting something important increases. There are also a few other bugs in `VMM.VXD` loader and itself in `VMM32.VXD`.

![More RAM than system handle](/doc/memory.gif)

Normally, 512 MB of RAM is enough for old hardware, but due to the design of virtual machine GPU adapters, we need at least 1 GB of RAM for 3D acceleration to work properly. A second problem when we want to run Windows 9x on bare metal on newer computers is that we can’t just reduce the memory, because smaller RAM modules aren't available.

This patch is a simple integration of [Rudolph Loew's PATCHMEM](http://lonecrusader.x10host.com/rloew/patchmem.html).

### Load VXD above 16 MB

Some drivers need free space in the first 16 MB, and the system itself uses space there for memory tables. Increasing RAM won't help here because more memory means larger tables, resulting in less free space. This patch frees some space below 16 MB by loading drivers above that point. This patch isn't enabled by default, and you can include it with this command:

```
patcher9x -select default,16m
```

(or from DOS)

```
patch9x -select default,16m
```

Or can also use the shorter equivalent (and *PATCHMEM* compatibility):

```
patcher9x -m
```

If you wish to apply only this patch (you already have other patches installed):

```
patcher9x -select 16m
```

If you wish to uninstall this (only this) patch:

```
patcher9x -reverse -select 16m
```

[More information is in the PATCHMEM manual](/doc/patchmem-manual.txt)

## Dirty control registry patch

Some BIOSes do not sufficiently reset the CPU control registers (CR0, CR2-CR4) and MSR registers. This can lead to "protection error" message on system load. Patch works same way as [CREGFIX](https://github.com/mintsuki/cregfix), but it is integrated to `win.com`. This is of course works only when system is loaded from the Real mode, when you're using DOS memory manager it is very dangerous to simply reset control registers, so when `win.com` is loaded in V86 mode, patch doesn't touch anything. When using memory manager you need to run original `cregfix.com` before load of memory manager.

## 4G Resource patch

When the system queries for reserved memory space, it assumes that results from BIOS calls (`EAX=0E820h; INT 15h`) are sorted. It also stops when it reaches a region with an address larger than 32 bits (>4 GB). Due to a "nobody cares" bug, results from many BIOSes are not sorted. When the system reaches a region > 32-bit address, it stops processing the results and ignores all following regions. This can cause some I/O space to be used as regular RAM, and writes to this location are likely to be disastrous.

This patch fixes the stop at the >32-bit region address. The original patch was made by [SweetLow](https://github.com/LordOfMice/Tools/) and the
[problem is described here](https://msfn.org/board/topic/186768-bug-fix-vmmvxd-on-handling-4gib-addresses-and-description-of-problems-with-resource-manager-on-newer-bioses/).

## Requirements

Currently supported operation systems:

- Windows 3.11
- Windows 95
- Windows 98
- Windows 98 SE
- Windows Me

Windows 3.11 has the CPU speed limit bug in NDIS.386 which prevents startup when networking is enabled, although it is still possible to startup with `win /n`.

Windows 95, 98 and 98 SE have the CPU speed limit bug. Windows 98 SE is a special case because it has "divide by zero" protection, but it also has a short loop test, so its timing information is probably useless and could potentially lead to other bugs.

Windows 98, 98 SE and Me have the TLB invalidation bug. The Millennium edition has this bug in the code, but from my observation, the system calls this code very rarely (for example with driver install/system update), so the bug isn't as obvious as in Windows 98. An older version of my patcher program also has a special mode for Windows Me, but in the current version it is no longer needed.

Some updates install newer version of some files, for example `VMM.VXD`: Q242161 (98 FE), Q288430 (98 SE), ME296773 (Me); `NTKERN.VXD`, `IOS.VXD`, `ESDI_506.PDR`, `SCSIPORT.PDR` and `NDIS.VXD`: Unofficial FIX95CPU. The patcher is compatible with these updates but is required to apply patches again after install. The best way is probably to run patcher from Windows (DOS or 32-bit version) before reboot - Windows 9x does not have any system files protection and you can overwrite system files in the running system. If you do not catch it and the system is rebooted to an error message, you will need to boot from a bootable floppy and start the patcher from it.

## Updating

Download newest version and run it. Program automatically determine when needs  to replace patches with newer ones. Currently there are following updates:
- 0.9.91: added 4G Resource patch, support above 16M load, fix missing parts in memory patch for W95
- 0.9.90: updated Dirty control registry patch (required for every 32 bit only CPU)
- 0.8.50: updated Windows 98/98 SE TLB patch (stability)

## Download

Binary files and bootable floppy image are in [Releases](https://github.com/JHRobotics/patcher9x/releases/)

IMA file is a bootable floppy (FREEDOS) usable in a virtual machine to simple boot and patch the installed system. Binaries for win32 are Windows 98 compatible, so they can be run from safe mode (Hold CTRL on start-up). Binaries for other systems are for creating patched installation (in theory you can mount virtual HDD image and patch installed system on it, but doing it using boot the floppy is much simpler).

The tool has also been packaged for Nix/NixOS:
`$ nix develop nixpkgs#patcher9x`
or
`$ nix-shell -p patcher9x`

## Installation

The simplest way is by downloading bootable floppy image. After booting (you will see `A:\`), run:
```
patch9x
```
Patch will be run in interactive mode and the default strategy (*patch files, VMM32.VXD will be patched directly*) is probably the best way even for later updates. After rebooting operation system should start successfully.

## Uninstall

Run Patcher9x with `-reverse` argument. For example, boot from boot floppy and type:
```
patch9x -reverse
```

You can also `-select`or `-unselect` argument to choose what patches remove, for example remove only memory patch:

```
patch9x -reverse -select mem
```

Or remove all patches and keep only TLB patch:

```
patch9x -reverse -unselect tlb
```

## Operation modes

### Interactive mode
This is default mode, the program asking questions and user answer. You can just double click on EXE (or type `patch9x` to DOS command prompt) and program guide to you in patching process. For Linux build, the help is prinded if no arguments are given (default behaviour for UNIX programs) so you need specify *path*.

Program automatically ties apply all patches, but if you wish apply only some, run program from command line with `-select` arguments following comma separated patches:

- tlb - TLB patches
- speeddrv - CPU speed patch fix for system VXDs
- speedndis - CPU speed patch for NDIS.VXD/NDIS.386
- speed - speeddrv + speedndis
- mem - memory limit patch
- creg - CPU registry cleanup on startup
- all - all patches (default)

For example apply only TLB and CPU speed patch:

```
patcher9x -select tlb,speed
```

### Automatic mode
Same as interactive but don't ask anything. Can be enabled with `-auto` switch and *path* to CAB files or 9x WINDOWS/SYSTEM directory needs to be specified.

### Batch mode
In this mode program operate with single steps. Examples:

Extract `VMM32.VXD` from installation media
```
patcher9x --cabs-extract D:\WIN98 VMM32.VXD
```

Extract VMM.VXD from VMM32.VXD
```
patcher9x --vxd-extract VMM32.VXD VMM.VXD
```

Patch individual file:
```
patcher9x --patch all VMM.VXD
```

Previous command tried to apply all patches and when match, it applied them. You can also be concrete about patch category, for example apply only TLB patch: 

```
patcher9x --patch tlb VMM.VXD
```

Argument syntax is same as for `-select` argument.

## Boot floppy
Boot floppy now contain CD driver and few utilities to prepare system disk. If you wish run Windows Installer from boot floppy, add `/NM` switch to `setup.exe` (because of different memory manager, the setup cannot determine real RAM size). Utilities are listed in [boot/info.txt](boot/info.txt). I also included some useful drivers and utilities listed in [boot/extra.txt](boot/extra.txt).

## Patching installation media
Copy the content of *win9x* folder (or *win95* - for Windows 95 or *win98* - for Windows 98)
from a CD / extract it from an ISO image. Then run: 
```
patcher9x /path/to/folder/win98
```
If the patch is successful, you can copy the modified files back to the image. These are the files marked with the 'N' flag in the patcher output. Or it will be one of these:
- `VMM32.VXD`
- `VMM.VXD`
- `NTKERN.VXD`
- `IOS.VXD`
- `ESDI_506.PDR`
- `SCSIPORT.PDR`
- `NDIS.VXD`
- `NDIS.386`
- `VCACHE.VXD`
- `WIN.COM` / `WIN.CNF`

The Windows installer primarily takes files from the installation folder and if it can't find them, it'll scan the CAB archives instead.

For Windows 95, it is better to patch the installation media, or you will need to install the patch twice - after the first reboot and again after the installation of the network.

**Please note, that file `VMM32.VXD` from installation IS NOT THE SAME as the file in `Windows/system` folder. Don't interchange them! See the _Patching process_ section to know more about the VMM files.**

## Build from source

To build from source you need:
- GNU C compiler compatible C compiler (minimal version 4.6, MinGW or DJGPP works)
- Flat assembler (https://flatassembler.net/)
- GNU Make (minimal version 3.81)

To build the binary for your computer, simply type:
```
make
```

To cross compile, specify the `HOST_CC` and `GUEST_CC` variables to choose compiler, for example cross compiling to 32bit Windows:
```
make HOST_CC=gcc GUEST_CC=mingw-w64-i686-gcc GUEST_WINDRES=mingw-w64-i686-windres WIN32=1
```

To produce a production binary, add `RELEASE=1` to `make`.

After compiling, you can strip the binary (reduce some space):
```
make strip
```

There is a special profile for DOS cross-compilation -- if you have DJGPP compiler, you can produce the DOS executable this way:
```
make RELEASE=1 PROFILE=djgpp
make strip
```

MinGW compiled programs are linked with `msvcrt.dll` by default. To eliminate this depency (`msvcrt.dll` is missing all Windows 9x versions where isn't IE 4 or better), this project can use my [NOCRT](https://github.com/JHRobotics/nocrt) library. Use `make PROFILE=nocrt` or `make PROFILE=nocrt64` to compile program for Windows with depency only to `kernel32.dll`.

**Executable file name for most real operation systems is called `patcher9x`. For DOS, it is called `patch9x.exe`  because file names are limited to 8+3 characters.**

## Patching process

### TLB invalidation bug patching

The patch itself is relatively simple: injecting 2 instructions (`mov ecx,cr3` and `mov cr3,ecx`) to the code in the `VMM.VXD` driver. The patch totally modifies 29 bytes in this file (for Windows 98). 

The problem is that `VMM.VXD` isn't in a normal state on the HDD. `VMM.VXD` is a part of `VMM32.VXD` which is a compressed archive of several `VXD` drivers. `VMM32.VXD` isn't a generic file -- it is generated by the installer exclusively for your HW configuration.

The system for loading drivers first searches in the `SYSTEM\VMM32` folder, and if the driver isn't there, it will search in the `VMM32.VXD` file.

If you want to know more about the code, see file [FlushMappedCacheBlock.asm](vmm/FlushMappedCacheBlock.asm)

[More info about W3/W4 files](doc/VXDLIB_UTF8.txt)

### CPU speed limit bug patching

In the beginning, I increased the number of cycles of older patches by 8 times (80 times more than the original code and in the case of NDIS.VXD, 100 times more than the original code). I also injected a small "divide by zero" protection, which looks like this:
```
VMMcall Get_System_Time ; original - system time (in ms) to EAX
sub eax,esi             ; original - compare with last time in ESI
jnz skip_inc            ; new      - skip if result is non-zero
  inc eax               ; new      - increase zero result by one
skip_inc:
```

There are two variants of this code - one for `NDIS.VXD` and one for all other system files.

The new number of test cycles is now *80 000 000* -- in older patches it was *10 000 000*, but a 4-year-old Ryzen 5 1400 CPU only needs 3 ms to run it through, so if you have a CPU which is 3 times faster[^1] you could have a problem here.

If you want to know more about the code, see file [speed.inc](cpuspeed/speed.inc)

[^1]: Single thread performance in `LOOP` instruction, number of cores, special instructions etc. are irrelevant.

## Development

In future I would like include ~~patch "CPU speed limit" (95, 98 FE)~~ and patch 48-bit LBA (95, 98, ME). ~Memory limit patch I want include too.~
